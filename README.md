## üìå Overview

Diabetic Retinopathy is a serious eye condition caused by diabetes that can lead to vision loss. Early and accurate detection is vital. This project leverages modern deep learning architectures to classify retinal images into five categories representing different stages of DR.

---

## üìä Dataset

We used the **APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection** dataset which includes:

- **3,662** training images
- **1,928** test images  
- **5 DR classes**:
  - No DR
  - Mild
  - Moderate
  - Severe
  - Proliferative DR

To address class imbalance, we curated a balanced subset:

- **Balanced Training Set**: 1500 images  
- **Testing Set**: 600 images (split from training leftovers)
